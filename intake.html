<h2>Intakes</h2>
<p class="intakeintro">Now that you have a moving drivetrain, it's time to move on to the intake. <strong>"Intake"</strong> is a broad term that refers to anything that aids your robot in collecting game elements.
At your average FTC competition, you will see all sorts of intakes ranging from complex mechanisms to robots with no intake at all. </p>
<p class="intakeintro">The better your intake, the faster your robot will be able to cycle and score game elements. In FRC robotics, there is a saying that I believe is relevant to intakes:<strong>"Touch It, Own It"</strong>
A successful, top-tier intake is one that allows your robot to control the game element in question as soon as it makes contact with your robot.</p>

    <img id="wheeledpic" src="images/yangintake.jpg" width=25% height=25% title="Wheeled Intake">
    <p>Wheeled intakes are a common intake in FTC. They involved using a series of compliant wheels to bring a game element into the robot. Wheeled intakes
    are generally most effective at intaking <strong>large, rectangular or square</strong> objects such as glyphs in Relic Recovery and stones in Skystone.</p>
    <p>Several factors are important in determining how effective a wheeled intake will be. This includes the <strong>angle compared to the horizontal that the wheels are at, the diameter of the wheels, the gear reduction of the motors powering the wheels, and the springing </strong>. In general, you want to get the most effective surface area of the wheels onto the game elements as possible.
    A common way to increase effective surface area is to "spring" your intake using a material with a high spring constant such as rubber bands or a spring. Doing this correctly will allow the wheels to conform to the game element, bringing it into the robot in a more efficient manner.</p>

<div id="rollerwords">
    <img id="rollerpic" src="images/roller.jpg" width=25% height=25% title="Rubber Band Roller Intake">
    <p>When dealing with <strong>smaller game elements</strong> in a <strong>larger quantity</strong>, roller intakes are normally the way to go. The intake above is a rubber band roller intake from a Vex team.</p>
    <p>Rollers are effective in intaking smaller game pieces where orientation of the piece within the robot doesn't matter. Examples of this style of game piece include balls and pieces that simply have to be dumped to be scored.
       Many great examples of roller system intakes can be found from <strong>Velocity Vortex</strong> robots. This game was a shooting game involving small, colorful wiffle balls. Most top teams used roller intake systems
       with <strong>surgical tubing</strong> or <strong>rubber bands</strong> on multiple rollers chained or belted together to bring scoring elements up to a certain point in the bot.</p>

<div id="passivewords">
    <img id="clawpic" src="images/claw.jpg" width=25% height=25% title="Claw Intake">
    <p>Passive intakes, such as the <strong>claw</strong> seen above, are generally not recommended for FTC due to their slow nature and reliance on top-notch driving to reliably collect game elements.</p>
    <p>While some teams have been successful with passive intakes in the past, you almost never see them at high levels. Instead, teams opt for active intakes such as wheeled intakes and roller intakes mentioned before.
       If you are set on using a passive intake, <strong>consider having some form of active intake</strong> to bring the game elements into the passive intake so that your passive intake is picking up objects in the same alignment every time.</p>
