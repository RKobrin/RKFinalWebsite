<h2>Introduction to FTC Design</h2>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with FTC robotics, or just getting started, I recommend that you find videos
    of robots that have been successful in previous seasons. You will probably start to notice a pattern. 
    Many successful robots have similar elements that make them efficient and effective scoring machines. After
    some thought, I decided that FTC robots can be broken down into 4 main subsystems: Drivetrain, Intake, Linear Motion Mechanism, and Scoring Mechanism.
    The main content of this website will be devoted to giving examples and educating readers about each of these subsytems.
