<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Robert, and I competed on FIRST Tech Challenge Team 731
    for two years as a part of the mech and design team. Through this website, 
    I hope to document as much of the knowledge that I have  gained through two years
    of dedication as possible. I hope you enjoy it! Please feel free to contact
    me with any questions or suggestions that you may have. 
</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I joined FTC 731 Wannabee Strange at the start of my junior year in high school after watching my 
    friends compete at the state competition the previous year. I quickly became immersed in robotics, 
    and I ended up captain of the team my senior year. My junior year, I was on the <strong>mech team</strong>
    and I served as a driver. We were on the <strong> finalist alliance</strong> at the North Carolina state championship,
    ranked <strong> top 60 </strong> in the world, and were a <strong> Worlds design award finalist.</strong>
</p>
<p>My senior year, I served as <strong>Team Captain</strong> and <strong>Design Lead</strong> for the team. While the World championship
    was cancelled, we were the <strong> design award winners</strong> at the North Carolina state championship.
