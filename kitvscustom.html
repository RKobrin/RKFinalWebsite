<h2>Kit Vs. Custom</h2>
<p class="kitvcustomintro">Over the last few years, FTC robotics has seem a rapid transition from manufacturer-created "kit" parts to custom solutions to game challenges. This begs the question, "Which is better?". While there is no simple answer
    to this, I wil attempt to give my thoughts on the matter below.
</p>
<p>Especially in the North Carolina region, it seems as though custom is on the rise. Many teams are attempting
    advanced custom solutions to problems. However, I believe that there is a fundamental flaw in this approach. <strong> There is no need for custom parts if you are not already getting the full strength out of manufacturer-produced parts</strong>
    . Similar to my views on odometry, I believe that teams should master the use of standard products before moving on to custom.</p>
<p>Even then, I am not convinced of the neccesity of custom. If you take a look at the past season, Skystone, you will see that <strong>none of the top 5 teams in the world were full custom robots</strong>
This is evidence enough to me that, while custom parts are cool and have their uses, a hybrid approach to robot design that involves both manufacturer-produced parts and custom parts when needed is currently optimal.</p>
